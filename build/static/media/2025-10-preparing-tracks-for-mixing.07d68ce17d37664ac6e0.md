# 5 Essential Tips for Preparing Your Tracks for Professional Mixing

As a professional mixing engineer with over 3 years of experience at Tornado Audio, I've seen it all - from perfectly organized sessions to complete chaos. The way you prepare your tracks can make a huge difference in the final mix quality and turnaround time.

Here are my top 5 tips for preparing your tracks before sending them to a mixing engineer.

## 1. Export at the Same Sample Rate and Bit Depth

This is crucial! Make sure all your tracks are exported at the **same sample rate and bit depth** that you recorded at. Don't convert or resample - let your mixing engineer handle that if needed.

**Best practices:**
- 24-bit / 48kHz or 44.1kHz is standard
- Never export at 8-bit or 16-bit if you recorded at 24-bit
- Keep it consistent across all tracks

## 2. Export from the Beginning of Your Session

Always export your tracks **from the very beginning** of your session (bar 1, beat 1), even if your song doesn't start until later. This ensures everything lines up perfectly when your engineer imports them.

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents timing issues
- Makes editing easier
- Ensures all tracks sync perfectly

## 3. Remove All Processing (Unless It's Essential)

Strip away compression, EQ, reverb, and other effects from your tracks before export - **unless** they're essential to the sound you're going for.

**What to remove:**
- Compression on individual tracks
- EQ (unless correcting a specific issue)
- Reverb and delay
- Master bus processing

**What to keep:**
- Amp simulators on guitars
- Synth effects that define the sound
- Creative effects that are part of the performance

## 4. Label Everything Clearly

Use clear, descriptive names for your tracks. Your mixing engineer shouldn't have to guess what "Audio_03_final_FINAL_v2" is.

**Good naming examples:**
- `Kick_In`
- `Snare_Top`
- `Lead_Vocal_Verse1`
- `Electric_Guitar_Chorus_L`
- `Bass_DI_Clean`

**Bad naming examples:**
- `Track 1`
- `Audio_03`
- `New Recording 45`

## 5. Include a Reference Mix and Notes

Send along a rough mix of your track (even if it's just a bounce from your DAW) and any specific notes about:

- What you like/don't like in your rough mix
- Reference tracks that inspire your sound
- Any specific instruments or elements you want featured
- Problem areas you've noticed

## Bonus Tip: Organize Your Files

Create a clear folder structure:
```
[Song Name] - [Artist Name]/
  ├── Drums/
  ├── Bass/
  ├── Guitars/
  ├── Vocals/
  ├── Keys/
  └── Reference_Mix.wav
```
