# 🎯 MongoDB Logging System - Quick Start Guide

## What I've Implemented

I've successfully created a **privacy-compliant MongoDB logging system** for your Tornado Audio website that tracks:

- ✅ **Visitor logs**: IP addresses (hashed), browser types, OS, devices, pages visited, referrers, geographic location
- ✅ **Event logs**: Contact form submissions, email success/failure, errors
- ✅ **All data collection complies with your Privacy Policy**

## ✨ Why MongoDB is Perfect for You

**YES, MongoDB is a great choice!** Here's why:
- **100% Free**: MongoDB Atlas free tier gives you 512MB storage (plenty for logging)
- **Easy Setup**: Just a connection string in your .env file
- **Flexible**: No rigid table schemas - perfect for logging varied events
- **Scalable**: Can handle millions of logs
- **Cloud-Hosted**: No server maintenance needed

## 📁 Files Created

### Core Files
1. **`models/VisitorLog.js`** - Tracks every page visit
2. **`models/EventLog.js`** - Tracks important events
3. **`utils/logger.js`** - Logging functions & middleware
4. **`routes/analytics.js`** - API endpoints to view your data

### Your server.js has been updated with:
- MongoDB connection
- Automatic visitor logging middleware
- Event logging in contact form
- Analytics API routes

## 🚀 How to Use

### Start Your Server

```bash
cd C:\Users\Hunte\WebstormProjects\tornadoaudio\server
npm start
```

You should see:
```
✅ Connected to MongoDB successfully
Server running on port 3001
```

### View Your Analytics

Once your server is running, you can access these endpoints:

**1. Summary Statistics**
```
http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/summary
```
Shows total visits, contact submissions, email stats

**2. Top Pages**
```
http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/top-pages
```
Which pages get the most traffic

**3. Traffic by Country**
```
http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/traffic-by-country
```
Where your visitors are from

**4. Browser Stats**
```
http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/browsers
```
What browsers people use

**5. Device Types**
```
http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/devices
```
Desktop vs Mobile vs Tablet

**6. Recent Contacts**
```
http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/recent-contacts
```
Contact form submissions

**7. Recent Errors**
```
http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/errors
```
Any errors that occurred

**8. Daily Visits (last 30 days)**
```
http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/daily-visits?days=30
```
Visitor trends over time

## 🔍 Viewing Data in MongoDB Atlas

1. Go to https://cloud.mongodb.com
2. Sign in
3. Click "Browse Collections"
4. You'll see two collections:
   - **visitorlogs** - Every page visit
   - **eventlogs** - Important events

## 📊 What Gets Logged Automatically

### Every Page Visit Logs:
- IP address (hashed for privacy)
- Browser & version
- Operating system
- Device type
- Page path
- Referrer (where they came from)
- Country & region
- Response time

### Every Contact Form Submission Logs:
- Contact details (name, email, project type)
- Email sending success/failure
- Geographic location
- Timestamp

## 🔒 Privacy & GDPR Compliance

✅ **Your system is privacy-friendly:**
- IP addresses are hashed (one-way encryption)
- Only data disclosed in your Privacy Policy is collected
- No PII stored without consent
- Logging failures don't break user experience

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### MongoDB Not Connecting?

**Check your connection:**
```bash
# Your .env file should have:
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://webserver:Hsu5p7NcAV3cNEM0@logs.a1jdndt.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Logs
```

**Test the connection:**
Visit `http://localhost:3001/api/health` - it should show database status

### Not Seeing Logs?

1. Make sure MongoDB connection succeeded (check server console)
2. Visit your website to generate traffic
3. Check MongoDB Atlas → Browse Collections
4. Visit an analytics endpoint to see data

### Server Won't Start?

Make sure mongoose and geoip-lite are installed:
```bash
cd C:\Users\Hunte\WebstormProjects\tornadoaudio\server
npm install
```

## 📈 Next Steps

### Create a Dashboard (Optional)

You can build a simple React component to visualize your analytics:

```javascript
// In your React app
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/summary')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data));
}, []);
```

### Set Up Automatic Cleanup

To prevent running out of space, you can add TTL (Time To Live) indexes to auto-delete old logs.

In `models/VisitorLog.js`, add:
```javascript
// Auto-delete logs older than 90 days
visitorLogSchema.index({ timestamp: 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 7776000 });
```

### Get Alerts for Errors

You could set up a cron job to check for errors and email you:

```javascript
// Check for errors every hour
setInterval(async () => {
  const errors = await EventLog.find({ success: false });
  if (errors.length > 0) {
    // Send yourself an email
  }
}, 3600000);
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **MongoDB Compass**: Download the free desktop app to visualize your data better
2. **Export Data**: You can export to CSV from MongoDB Atlas
3. **Index Important Fields**: Already done for common queries
4. **Monitor Storage**: Free tier has 512MB - should last years for your traffic
