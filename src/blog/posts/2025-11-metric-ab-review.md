# 🎛️ Plugin Review: Metric AB

In my last post on [Common Mixing Mistakes](slug: "common-mixing-mistakes"), I drilled home the importance of using reference tracks. Mixing in a vacuum is the fastest way to get a mix that doesn't "translate"—sounding great in your studio but falling apart in a car or on earbuds.

For years, the process of A/B referencing was clumsy. You'd have to import tracks into your DAW, set up complex routing, and constantly fight with faders to match loudness. Then, I found the **Plugin Alliance ADPTR Metric AB**.

This plugin now lives on the master bus of every single mix and mastering session I do at Tornado Audio. It’s not just a utility; it’s a critical tool for maintaining perspective. Here’s why.

## 1. What Is Metric AB and Why Bother? 🤷‍♂️

At its core, Metric AB is an advanced A/B comparison tool. You load it as the very last plugin on your master bus, and it allows you to load up to **16 reference tracks** (yes, 16!) directly into the plugin.

With the click of a single, giant "A/B" button, you can instantly switch between your mix (A) and your chosen reference track (B).

This solves the single biggest challenge in audio: **perspective**. Your ears get fatigued and *will* lie to you after hours of work. Metric AB is the objective, honest friend that tells you the truth about your mix.

## 2. The Most Important Feature: Loudness Matching 📈

If you take one thing away from this review, let it be this. The human ear is biologically programmed to believe that **louder is better**.

### The Problem:
When you compare your unmastered mix (let's say it's peaking at -6 dBFS) to a professionally mastered reference track (at 0 dBFS), the reference will be *dramatically* louder. It will always sound punchier, brighter, and "better," even if your mix is perfectly balanced. You get discouraged and start making bad decisions, like over-compressing your mix to compete.

### The Solution:
Metric AB has an instant **"Loudness Match"** button. When you press it, the plugin analyzes your "A" mix and your "B" reference and automatically turns the *reference track down* to match the perceived loudness of your own mix.

This is a complete game-changer. For the first time, you can do a true, apples-to-apples comparison of **tonal balance**, not just volume. You'll finally be able to hear if your mix is *actually* muddier or if your vocals are *really* too quiet, without loudness bias tricking you.

## 3. How I Use It for Mixing 🎧

During the mixing phase, I'm not worried about final loudness. I'm focused on balance, depth, and clarity. Metric AB is my co-pilot.

* **Checking the Low End**: Am I too boomy? Or too thin? I use Metric AB's **Filter buttons** to solo just the low-end (e.g., 0-120 Hz). I then flip between my mix and the reference. In 10 seconds, I can tell if my kick and bass relationship is in the right ballpark.
* **Vocal Placement**: I use the "Mid" filter to check my vocal's relationship to the instruments. Is my vocal as clear and present as the reference, or is it being buried?
* **Stereo Width**: The plugin has built-in Correlation and Stereo Image meters. I can quickly see if my mix is as wide and immersive as the reference, or if I've gone too wide and started to create phase issues.

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Use the **'Cue' playback mode**. This lets you tap the 'B' button to play your reference for a set time (e.g., 2 seconds) before it automatically flips back to your mix. This is incredible for "resetting" your ears and getting a quick reality check without losing your creative flow.

## 4. How I Use It for Mastering 💥

For mastering, Metric AB is non-negotiable. This is where you're making the final, critical adjustments to ensure the track is commercially competitive.

Here, I turn *off* the Loudness Match and use the plugin's full suite of mastering-grade meters to compare my master directly against the commercial release.

* **Loudness (LUFS)**: The Loudness meter shows me the Integrated, Short-Term, and Momentary LUFS of both my master and the reference. I can instantly see if I'm in the right "zone" for the genre.
* **Dynamics (PSR)**: This is my secret weapon. The "Dynamics" meter measures the Peak-to-Short-Term-Loudness Ratio (PSR). This value tells you how "punchy" or "squashed" a track is. I can ensure my master has similar punch and life as the reference, avoiding the "over-compressed" sound that plagues so many amateur masters.
* **Spectrum Analysis**: The spectrum analyzer can be overlaid, showing my mix's frequency curve (blue) against the reference's (orange). This allows me to spot any major tonal imbalances at a glance.

## 5. The Verdict: Is It Worth It? ✨

**Yes. 100%.**

There are other referencing plugins, but none are as fast, stable, and feature-complete as Metric AB. It's the only plugin that combines instant A/B, loudness matching, cue/loop functions, and a full-featured mastering analysis suite in one window.

It removes the guesswork from mixing and mastering. It's the difference between *hoping* your mix translates and *knowing* it will.
