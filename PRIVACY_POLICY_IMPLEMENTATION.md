# Privacy Policy & Terms of Service Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive implementation of Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages for tornadoaudio.net, including routing improvements and style consistency.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New Pages Created
- **Privacy Policy** (`/privacy-policy`)
  - Comprehensive privacy policy covering all aspects of data collection and usage
  - Required for ad network compliance (Google AdSense, Meta Ads, etc.)
  - Includes sections on cookies, data security, user rights, and GDPR compliance

- **Terms of Service** (`/terms-of-service`)
  - Legal terms covering service usage, payment terms, intellectual property rights
  - Revision policy and project delivery timelines
  - Liability limitations and indemnification clauses

### 2. Routing System Enhancements

#### React Router Integration
- Implemented React Router v7 with BrowserRouter
- Created dedicated routes for:
  - `/` - Main homepage
  - `/privacy-policy` - Privacy Policy page
  - `/terms-of-service` - Terms of Service page

#### Smart Navigation Logic
The Header component now uses conditional rendering based on the current page:
- **On Homepage**: Uses hash anchors (#home, #services, #portfolio, #pricing, #contact)
- **On Other Pages**: Uses React Router Links to navigate back to homepage sections
- Logo is now clickable and returns users to the homepage from any page

### 3. Dark Mode Support
All new pages fully support dark mode using CSS variables:
- `--bg-primary`, `--bg-secondary`, `--bg-card` for backgrounds
- `--text-primary`, `--text-secondary`, `--text-muted` for text colors
- `--primary-color`, `--primary-gradient` for accent colors
- Automatic theme switching based on system preferences

### 4. Cohesive Styling
- Used the same design system as the main site
- Consistent typography, spacing, and color scheme
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Professional footer matching the main site

### 5. User Experience Improvements

#### Navigation
- Header navigation works correctly on all pages
- Logo click returns to homepage
- Footer links on all pages (Home, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service)
- Automatic scroll to top when navigating to policy pages

#### Accessibility
- Proper semantic HTML with header, main, footer, and section tags
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast for readability

### 6. SEO Enhancements
